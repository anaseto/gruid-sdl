The *gruid-sdl2* module provides a [gruid](https://github.com/anaseto/gruid)
Driver for using the [SDL2 library](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) to
build native graphical applications.

The module's package is called sdl.  For it to work, you need to install the
[SDL2 library](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) on your system before.

Be sure to install the dev version of the package, for distributions that make
such a distinction. For example, in Debian-derived systems, a command like `apt
install libsdl2-dev` may be used.
